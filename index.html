        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="solid">My name is Briana Ruiz-Gonzalez I am a 12th grader at Summit Public School Rainier. I travel around as often as 1-3 times a month, I've been to Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Mexico. I'm open minded when it comes to new things like for example getting to know a new culture, foods, and adventures. I really enjoy the art community so I am pretty active in that, whenever there is an art show, dance off, MC night, or skating events I'm usually there. Hip-Hop has been an important part of life for about 10 years now, I love learning new techniques and skills as well as talking to people and hearing their different stories. It's a little strange that a teenage that isn't just from an urban community but interacts with the Hip-Hop community works at TransAmerica. Yes, I do work at TransAmerica but I find my job really interesting. I like it, I like that fact that I educate people about their finances and explain what they have and what they can have. I'm lucky to be taught about the business from the person who works next to the CEO of the company. Overall, My life consumes of being busy and outgoing.
